# JavaScript_Typing_Speed_Tester
JavaScript Event Listener App ( Exercise )

In this project I managed to set a timer and trigger it as soon as the user starts to type in an input element. This was done adding an Event Listener with the event type of "keypress". Also in the real time, I compare the user's text with the original text using the "keyup" event type. The user has also the possibility of resetting the whole session by clicking on a button which clears the interval and resets visually the fields. In other words, as soon as the user starts typing a new interval session is started. 

I learned to : 

- use the event listeners,

- manipulate DOM elements and change HTML content or CSS properties,

- working with arrays,

- setting and clearing an interval ( timer ).
